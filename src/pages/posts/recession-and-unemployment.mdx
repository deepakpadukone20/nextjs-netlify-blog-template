Considering the current situation of recession and covid19 especially, world’ economy has got a big hit. India’ GDP has decreased by 9.6% in 2020. Infact recession incurred because of covid 19 is often compared with the ‘The Great Depression’ that lasted around a decade from 1920s-1930s.

Because of the prevailing situation, many people are losing their jobs . Many companies have also hold back their job offers from college graduates. There has been a hit on many start ups, small and medium scale businesses. Some companies have reduced the wages of their employees.

Not just this, because of the fear of catching infection, people have reduced using the non trusted mode of commute, like auto-rickshaws, community buses, metros, where crowd is more, or which do not guarantee sanitization. There has been a major affect on travel and tourism sectors, aviation, and automobile manufacturing sectors as well.

Other sectors which have been severely affected are electronics, toys manufacturing companies, cosmetics, manufacturing of luxury items. Since majority of electronic units used in smartphones, televisions, and toys, are based out of China. With the current global tension, many countries including India are showing distrust in doing any sort of business with China.

With these situations, inflation is on it’s peak, and it’s expected to increase further in near future. In such difficult time, it’s getting really difficult to sustain in the world without a well defined source of income, which can assure us and our closed ones with the security of keep going if situation worsens.

There are many sectors that have come up with solutions to mitigate the unemployment crisis. As for example, the factories associated with healthcare sectors, which are responsible for manufacturing of sanitization products, masks, gloves, and other chemical industries are providing good employment opportunities.

Government has come up with Make In india initiative that promotes the manufacturing sector of India. This, on one hand, will create huge set of job vacancies, and on the other, it will also give us opportunity to put ourselves out there in the position to prove our expertise to the Government is also comping up with many opportunities to overcome unemployment crisis in the country.

We would like to help people in need, to connect with their next job, and boost their career to the next level.
