Why use Facebook Messenger ads? As more and more people turn to private messaging on social media —and since FB [combined its messaging backend](https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/new-messaging-features-for-instagram/) with Instagram — Messenger ads have never been more relevant.

More than [one billion people](https://www.facebook.com/iq/insights-to-go/tags/messenger?ref=fbb_messenger_ads) use Messenger every month, including the 78% of smartphone users who are sending messages.

* Meanwhile, businesses exchange more than [20 billion messages](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/f8-2019-making-it-easier-for-businesses-to-connect-with-customers-on-messenger/#) monthly with Messenger users.
